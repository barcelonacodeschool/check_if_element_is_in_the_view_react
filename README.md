# Check if element is visible in the view

SOmetimes we want to trigger a certain action, maybe animation, styles change, call to action, etc. only once a certain element of the page is in the viewport, we do not want to do it until user will scroll down to it. 

This demo shows how to do so with react-hook-match-media package.
